// CLI auto-upgrade helpers — install-method detection and message formatting.

// `cli_upgrade_required`. The goal is to print a single, machine-parseable
// line the agent can lift verbatim — and tell the human (or the agent's
// harness) exactly what to run instead of a generic "upgrade @homespunapps/cli".
//
// Detection is best-effort: we inspect `process.execPath` and the CLI's own
// install path. There's no programmatic "ask npm what installed me" API, so
// the heuristics below are matched against the well-known install layouts
// of each package manager. Anything unrecognized lands in `unknown`, which
// means "tell the agent to ask the human" rather than guess.
